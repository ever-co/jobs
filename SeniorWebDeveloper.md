# Senior Web Developer
We are looking for Senior Web Developers with work experience. You must be someone who is smart, very motivated and has built multiple projects during your learning and work.

### About Us
* We are building custom software for customers worldwide: USA / UK / Australia, lots of interesting and challenging projects, guaranteed!
* We are building multiple open-source platforms, so you will contribute to the popular & growing open-source projects directly on Github!

### Our requirements and your skills
* Mostly you will be doing full-stack Web development using JavaScript / TypeScript / Angular and NodeJS or .NET. So we are looking for developers who will be able to work full-stack, both on client-side and server-side. 
* Most of your time you will spend with Angular on front-end, so only apply if you worked with this framework, please.
* On the server-side, we are using mostly NodeJS (and sometimes .NET). So some good experience with any (or both) of them will work for us.
*  We do require a developer to use TypeScript for a while in the past. You need to be able to understand the complex reactive code and learn new things extremely fast.
* In addition, you need to feel comfortable working with one (or more) of SQL DBs (e.g. MySQL, MS SQL, etc) and/or MongoDB.
* Experience with the Ionic framework considered a bonus.
*  Experience with both .NET and NodeJS also considered as a bonus.

The link to your Github page, full of repos with your commits is very welcome! It's not necessary should be huge apps, but something which will show you can build things from the first days at work!

*  Learn new things extremely fast and can work on tasks independently and in the team
* Communication skills in verbal and written English (you should be able to explain and understand technical things, even if your English is not perfect)

### Benefits for you
* Tons of interesting projects - you will be doing contributions to both proprietary and open-source software!
* Free drinks at the office
* Flexible working hours
* Transportation compensation (365 leva per year)
* Sports club membership (free)
* Work from home/remote option
* Monthly/yearly bonus (after the trial period we pay additional bonuses based on your performance, monthly!)
* Free training/courses (optional, after trial)
* Tickets for conferences and seminars (optional, after trial)

Please apply with your CV (in English only) and state your salary expectations in Levs (required).
We want to hire the best of the best, but we also can teach you how to be one.

So, the compensation depends on your experience & current skills set, we are very flexible and want you to grow with us! At the same time, expect lots of hard work (but without overtime or deadlines) and expect real compensation depending on your skills, not something abstract or unreasonably large (we are still very agile and lean company).
